# Title 1
We must now discuss the issue of note taking...
## Sub title 1
Can I take detailed typed notes with inline maths? The question really becomes, is $x >> y$

This is a question that is not easily answered. Yet it is a question that we must approach with no hesitancy because as myself always said...

>Hesitancy is shit

Which I do not think is entirely untrue.

Also there's math! With aligned equations and everything which is pretty great!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    y &= 92\\
    x &= 462\\
    f &= 24
\end{aligned}
$$

And there's code.

```javascript

function add(x, y){
    return x + y;
}

function draw(){

}

```
